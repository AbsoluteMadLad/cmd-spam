# cmd-spam
The program; cmd-spam does what the name says, it opens approximately 200 cmd windows per minute. This program only works on Microsoft Windows from what I have tested.
I have included Google Chrome and Internet Explorer .ico files so you can easily disguise cmd-spam. Personally, I use a Firefox Developer Edition .ico, in which I have also included.
